What does the app do?
The app will function like a social media app with one key difference, you start with friends/connections. If a user makes an account and allows themselves to be ‘open to mentoring others’ then through some recommendation algorithm I will try to match them to a new user with similar goals as to what they are currently doing. This way students who feel ‘lost’ and don't know what to do can seek advice from someone who has already done it. This takes the hardest part of finding a mentor (actually finding someone  who is willing to help AND doing what you want to do) out of the equation and allows you to focus all your energy on professional development 
Key Features 
DM Functionality 
User auth/ accounts 
Member directory 
Profile Editing 
Start with friends/connections through a recommendation algorithm
Potential Idea (resume helper)
Yuchen gave me the idea of having my social media apps cool feature being a ‘resume pad’ where it would basically be a version of google docs but optimized for resumes making it super easy to edit smaller things like spacing along your resume and allowing you to export it as a pdf. This is similar to how Leetcode has a built ‘coding pad’ to run your code. 
AI leveraged feedback on resume to help it pass ATS systems

Overview
Category: Social Networking
Story: Users sign up to gain resources as to what their next steps should be in securing a role in today's software engineering market. Many students, including myself, enter college with no connections or prior experience in tech. If it weren’t for some people I've met along the way I wouldn’t be where I am today. This app aims to bridge that gap and give anyone access to information and resources allowing them to plan out their next steps in securing that first role instead of being lost.
Market: UW-Madison students who want to land a role in tech but don’t know how to start (likely underclassmen w/out family in tech)
Habit: App will likely be used weekly to daily depending on how often users are wanting to message mentors and use the apps built in resources 
Scope: Professional Development
